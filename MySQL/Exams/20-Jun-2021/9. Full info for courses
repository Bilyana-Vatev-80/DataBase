# The headquarters want us to make a query that shows the complete information about all courses in the database.
# The information that they need is the address, if the course is made in the Day (between 6 and 20(inclusive both))
# or in the Night (between 21 and 5(inclusive both)),
# the bill of the course, the full name of the client, the car maker, the model and the name of the category.
# Order the results by course id.
