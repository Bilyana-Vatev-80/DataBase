# Select all drivers and cars that they drive. Extract the driverâ€™s first and last name from the drivers table
# and the make, the model and the mileage from the cars table.
# Order the result by the mileage in descending order, then by the first name alphabetically.
# Skip all cars that have NULL as a value for the mileage.
